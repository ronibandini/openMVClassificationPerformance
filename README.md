# openMVClassificationPerformance
For this project I have trained a simple classification model using Edge Impulse. I took 30 pictures of a Lego figure and 30 pictures of a small blue ball. I have created an Impulse with 96x96 px images and a Classification Learning Block. These items are very distinct from one another so the classification is quite easy from a machine learning perspective, but that is because we are more interested in evaluating the performance and ease of use of the OpenMV RT1062 here. In the future we could always explore more difficult ML tasks.
